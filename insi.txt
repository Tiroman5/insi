I want to tell you something that could make a difference: The truth is that these documents of text are written in Morse and can be undecoded up to UNL amount of times. But it differs between document by document. Tell me now, how do you like this idea: To undecode them up to the maximum? Do not do it other than second highest, or not. Because it could be the best of ideas and information that can be implemented. Think like this: Every new level that is undecoded will be more advanced through the method. So it takes time to undecode these documents now through Morse, or not. Because this security catalog can contain a bitcoin wallet that can pay for them to undecode automatically. More so, if you want to withdrew the preview of your payment, you can. And if someone else has undecoded them already, you do not pay. I Think that every new level will add Another double amount of text too. So remember one more thing: The universe has unlimited plans, but it is not in actuality true. Because every new text of information, it will have its own amount of plans in case something fails you need that maximum as a reserve plan. I also exist infragralic as proof of that I am a human Morse being through air. Can you succeed with this the World is in a better Place. I tell again: The combination of electronisation and digitalisation must match with the prediction of how these documents should be interpreted. I like some of these dll files too: Modraland Himself is a good song. Modraland Scale a good story. Are you willing to pay a Little extra on this document, I name it insi.txt
